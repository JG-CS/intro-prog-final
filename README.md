# intro-prog-final
Final project for my Introduction to Programming class at University of Puerto Rico - RÃ­o Piedras Campus
Language: C++
Noteworthy:
  First time I created a class using separate header and implementation files
  Implemented bubble sort and selection sort algorithms
  
The program takes an input file containing randomized sequences, each 10 values long. All the values are then normalized, and mean and standard deviation are calculated for each individual sequence. Afterwards, the bubble sort and selection sort algorithms are used to sort the values within each sequence from smallest to largest, as well as sort all sequences from smallest mean value to largest mean value. The sorted sequences are then saved to another file.
